# GODOT - a project requirements mgmt tool

## What it is

This application is a project requirement mgmt tool with the potential,    
to become a new 'Project Management' tool with an approach which is less 'Scrum'    
and more 'DevOps'.    
The goal is to also implement an evaluation algorithm for both sides 'customer' and 'contributor'(developer) parties, 
for which persons to choose for which roles in the project.
Another goal is to implement a project management circle with project-status and project-status-segments.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (version 22 or higher)

## Next Steps


-   [ ] Build the basic skeleton. 
-   [ ] Build a reusable .env file 
-   [ ] Implement a basic todo list like from the tutorial. 
-   [ ] Create basic CRUD operations.
-   [ ] Set up a database connection.
-   [ ] Write UML on how to proceed.
-   [ ] Restructure basic code scribble to follow a more conventional Svelte approach.
-   [ ] Implement user authentication.
-   [ ] Going closed source :) ...or I'll find a sponsor and keep it open. :P
